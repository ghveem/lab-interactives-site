  "about": "The total energy radiated by an object per unit time is proportional to\nthe fourth power of its absolute temperature *T* (in Kelvin, 0°C≈273K):\n\nP=εσAT<sup>4</sup>\n{: .formula}\n\nwhere *A* is the surface area of the object, *σ* is the Stefan-Boltzmann\nconstant, and *ε* is the emissivity of the object\\'s material. This is\nknown as the **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**.\n\nThe emissivities of materials vary. If the object is a perfect black\nbody, *ε*=1. Metals tend to have a very low emissivity. Water and paper,\non the other hand, have high emissivity (0.95).\n\nThe following model shows the temperature dependence of the radiation\npower.\n\n**Important Note:** Light radiation from the hot plate is represented by\na limited number of rays, each of which travels at a much slower speed\nthan the speed of light. This is a computational approximation that does\nnot reflect the nature of light energy.\n\n",
