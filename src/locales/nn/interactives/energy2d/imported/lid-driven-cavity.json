  "about": "The lid-driven cavity flow involves a fluid in a square box driven by\nconstant \\\"blow\\\" near the lid. Depending on the physical conditions, a\nstable eddy can form within the box (as shown by the streamlines). You\nmay notice that when a stable eddy occupies the entire box, its center\nis actually cooler than the edge, indicating the faster heat transfer\nrate through forced convection than through conduction. The lid-driven\ncavity problem is one of the most important benchmarks for computational\nfluid dynamics.\n\n",
