  "about": "This model shows the effect of natural convection in a house.\n\n1.  Run the model, turn the graph on, and observe the temperatures.\n2.  Record the steady temperatures of the three thermometers, T1, T2,\n    and T3, when the ceiling is present.\n3.  Click the ceiling (the green piece) and press the DELETE key on your\n    keyboard to remove it.\n4.  Record the temperatures of the three thermometers again.\n\nYou may turn the streamlines on to observe the convective flow in more\ndetails.\n\nAfter you have completed your investigation, answer the questions in\nyour workbook.\n\n",
