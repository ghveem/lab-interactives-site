  "subtitle": "Does a hotter object radiate more energy?",
  "about": "This model shows how two heat radiators at different temperatures warm\nup remote objects through radiation. The dashed lines that will radiate\nout from the radiators represent invisible thermal radiation, which\npasses energy across space. Two thermometers are used to measure the\nheat gains at the objects.\n\n1.  Turn the graph on to monitor the change of temperatures.\n2.  Change the temperature of the left-hand side object using the radio\n    buttons below the model.\n3.  Compare the heating effect of the radiation at different\n    temperatures.\n4.  Reset the model each time you change the temperature of the\n    left-hand side object.\n\nAfter you have completed your investigation, answer the questions in\nyour workbook.\n\n",
