  "about": "How much heat is stored in an object depends on its specific heat, as\ndescribed by the formula below:\n\n\n\n| *Q* = <font color=\"red\">***c*<sub>p</sub>***m*(*T*<sub>final</sub>-*T*<sub>initial</sub>) </font>\n\n |\n{: cellpadding=\"10\" border=\"0\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"}\n\nThis model is similar to 1A, except that the specific heats of the two\nrectangular objects are different.\n\n1.  Run the model and note the temperatures measured by the two\n    thermometers.\n2.  Turn the graph on to watch the changes of the temperatures.\n3.  Use the buttons at the upper-right corner of the graph window to\n    rescale the curves if necessary.\n4.  Wait until the temperatures of the two objects do not change any\n    further.\n5.  Record the final temperature of the two objects in your workbook.\n\n**Click the Reset button** and change the specific heats of the two\nobjects using the drop-down menus below the model. Repeat steps 1-5 for\ntwo more different setups. Make sure that the specific heats are\ndifferent in each setup.\n\n",
