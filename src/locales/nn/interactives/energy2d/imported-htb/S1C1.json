  "about": "How much heat stored in an object depends on its mass, or size, as\ndescribed by the formula below:\n\n\n\n| *Q* = *c*<sub>p</sub><font color=\"red\">***m***(*T*<sub>final</sub>-*T*<sub>initial</sub>) </font>\n\n |\n{: cellpadding=\"10\" border=\"0\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"}\n\nNote that the specific heats of the two rectangular objects are\ndifferent. **Your task is to change the size of one or both\nobjects—hence the mass—so that the equilibrium temperature will be\napproximately 25°C.**\n\n1.  To change the size of an object, click and drag the small yellow\n    rectangles at its edges.\n2.  **Make sure that the objects still touch each other but do not\n    overlap and there is a thermometer in each object.**\n3.  Run the model and wait until the temperatures do not change any\n    further.\n4.  If the final temperatures are close to 25°C (within 1°C), write down\n    the sizes of the objects in your workbook.\n5.  Otherwise, click the Reset button, resize the objects, and run the\n    model again until the final temperatures are close to 25°C (within\n    1°C).\n\nYou may use the grid and the ruler as visual assistance when you drag\nthe rectangles.\n\nUse the drop-down menu under the model to change to a different setup of\nspecific heats and repeat the task.\n\n",
