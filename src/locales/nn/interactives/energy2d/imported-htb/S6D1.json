  "about": "This is a model of sunlight shining on a house with one window (white).\n\n1.  Run the model and watch the house heat up.\n2.  Change the sun angle by pressing on the \\'Q\\' or \\'W\\' on the\n    keyboard.\n3.  Try different sun angles â€” a low angle (winter) and a high angle\n    (summer).\n4.  Turn off sunlight to see how the house loses heat (night condition).\n5.  Be sure to reset the model between experiments.\n\nAfter you have completed your investigation, answer the questions in\nyour workbook.\n\n",
