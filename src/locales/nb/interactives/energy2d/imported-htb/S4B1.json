  "about": "This model has two compartments with a warm surface at the bottom. In\nthe middle of the right-hand compartment there is a barrier. **Your task\nis to compare the rates of the convective heat transfer from the bottom\nto the top in the two compartments.**\n\n1.  Run the model and note the temperatures measured by the two\n    thermometers.\n2.  Turn the graph on to watch the changes of the temperatures.\n3.  Use the buttons at the upper-right corner of the graph window to\n    rescale the curves if necessary. Click on a thermometer to highlight\n    its data.\n4.  When the model stops, write the temperatures measured by the\n    thermometers and the temperature at the bottom heater in your\n    workbook.\n5.  Try changing the location of the barrier or adding more barriers.\n    Click on the barrier to change size, move, or copy it.\n6.  Try to connect what you observe in this model to the attic in a\n    house.\n\n",
