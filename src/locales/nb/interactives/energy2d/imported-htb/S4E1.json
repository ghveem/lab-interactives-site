  "about": "This model investigates the effect of wind blowing towards a building.\nThe air currents are indicated by arrows and can be shown by\nstreamlines.\n\n1.  Run the model and note the convection and heating patterns both\n    inside and outside the house, heated by a heating board on the\n    floor.\n2.  Change the wind condition and open or close the windows to examine\n    how heat flow will change.\n\nAfter you have completed your investigation, answer the questions in\nyour workbook.\n\n",
