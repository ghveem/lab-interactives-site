  "about": "This model has two parts with a warm surface at the bottom. The\nright-hand side is a solid material that happens to have the same\nconductivity as air. The left-hand side is just air. Warmer air heated\nby the hot surface has a buoyant force upward. **Your task is to compare\nthe rates of the heat flow from the bottom to the top in the two\nparts.**\n\n1.  Run the model and note the temperatures measured by the two\n    thermometers.\n2.  Turn the graph on to watch the changes of the temperatures.\n3.  Use the buttons at the upper-right corner of the graph window to\n    rescale the curves if necessary. Click on a thermometer to highlight\n    its data.\n4.  When the model stops, write the temperatures measured by the\n    thermometers and the temperature at the bottom heater in your\n    workbook.\n\nReset the model. Set the bottom temperature to be \\\"Low\\\" and \\\"High\\\"\nand repeat steps 1-4, respectively.\n\n",
