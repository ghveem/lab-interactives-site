  "about": "The model shows two contacting objects that have identical mass (*m*)\nand specific heat (*c*<sub>p</sub>) but different initial temperatures.\nThe amount of heat transferred between them measures the heat initially\nstored in the warmer object.\n\n1.  Run the model and note the temperatures measured by the two\n    thermometers.\n2.  Turn the graph on to watch the changes of the temperatures.\n3.  Use the buttons at the upper-right corner of the graph window to\n    rescale the curves if necessary. Click on a thermometer to highlight\n    its data.\n4.  Wait until the temperatures of the two objects do not change any\n    further.\n5.  Record the final temperature of the two objects in your workbook.\n\n**Click the Reset button** and change the initial temperatures of the\ntwo objects using the drop-down menus below the model. Repeat steps 1-5\nfor two more different temperature setups.\n\n",
