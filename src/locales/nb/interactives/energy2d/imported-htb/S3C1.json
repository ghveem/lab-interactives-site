On the left are two separate heat sources with a constant temperature.  On the right are two separate objects with a thermometer that measures how much heat has been conducted. The upper test piece is twice as long as the lower one. Both are made of the same material.  This would be like a thick wall compared to a thin one. \n\n</p> <ol> <li>Run the model and note the temperatures measured by the two thermometers.  </li> <li>Turn the graph on to watch the changes of the temperatures.  </li> <li>Use the buttons at the upper-right corner of the graph window to rescale the curves if necessary. </li> </ol>\n\n<p>After you observe the model, answer the questions in your workbook.  </p>\n</i></td></tr></table>\n\n",
