  "about": "There are two warm objects in this model, separated by a thin, long\ninsulator in the middle. In the upper part, there is a fan blowing from\nleft to right. In the lower part, there is no fan blowing.\n\n1.  Run the model and note the temperatures measured by the two\n    thermometers.\n2.  Turn the graph on to watch the changes of the temperatures.\n3.  Use the buttons at the upper-right corner of the graph window to\n    rescale the curves if necessary.\n4.  After the model has run for about 0.4 model hour (the time for the\n    model, not real time), write the temperatures measured by the\n    thermometers in your workbook.\n\nSet the wind speed to be \\\"Low\\\" and \\\"High\\\" and repeat steps 1-4,\nrespectively.\n\nAfter you have completed your investigation, answer the questions in\nyour workbook.\n\n",
