  "about": "This simulation starts at 12am and assumes that the sun rises at 6am and\nsets at 6pm. So in the first few seconds you may not see heating. Just\nwait for a while until the sun shines in. Notice that the moving clouds\ncause some small random fluctuations in the temperature graph.\n\n",
