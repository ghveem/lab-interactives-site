  "about": "A bolometer consists of a radiation absorber connected to a thermal\nreservoir (a body of constant temperature) through a thermal conductor.\nThe radiation on the absorber raises its temperature above that of the\nreservoir: The greater the radiation intensity, the more energy the\nabsorber absorbs, and the higher its temperature rises. Hence, a\nbolometer can be used to measure radiation intensity.\n\n",
