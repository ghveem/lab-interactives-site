  "about": "Newton\\'s Law of Cooling suggests that the hotter an object is, the more\nthermal energy it loses through convection. The following model\ndemonstrates this. Notice the linear dependence of transferred heat on\nthe temperature of the heater: If the temperature is twice as high, the\nconvected heat will be approximately twice as much.\n\n",
