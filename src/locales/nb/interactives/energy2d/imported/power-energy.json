  "about": "Energy (*Q*) and power (*P*) are related by *Q* = *Pt*. This means the\nlonger (*t*) you turn on a heater, the more heat (*Q*) it will produce.\nAnd the higher the power (*P*) is, the more heat (*Q*) it will produce.\n\nTwo identical, closed boxes each have a round heater at the center, with\nthe power output as labeled. Instructions: 1) Run the model and turn the\ngraph on to monitor the temperatures; 2) Use the buttons at the\nupper-right corner of the graph window to rescale the curves if\nnecessary; 3) Calculate **the ratio of the temperatures** measured by\nthe two thermometers in the two boxes and compare it with **the ratio of\nthe heating powers**.\n\n",
