  "about": "The amount of heat transferred from an object to your hand or vice versa\ndetermines what you really feel when you touch it. The model uses two\ncontacting objects at different temperatures to simulate the heat\ntransfer of touch. The amount of heat transferred between them depends\non a number of factors that you will explore with this simulation.\n\n",
